<!--start of audition requirements-->
<div class="auditionrequirements">
  <h1 class="grid_6 prefix_3"> Audition Requirements</h1>
  <p class="grid_10 prefix_1 suffix_1">All music to be used for auditions is currently available here to students and to private music teachers at any time. Additional requirements for each WVYS ensemble and instrument is available below.</p>
  <p class="grid_10 prefix_1 suffix_1"> Strings - All new students wishing to audition will play for all three conductors on the published audition date(s). Auditions will be held in the spring and fall for the upcoming season. Conductors will determine which WVYS ensemble is appropriate for each student. At the discretion of the conductors and as the need arises, new students may be invited to audition at other times of the year.</p>

  <p class="grid_10 prefix_1 suffix_1">Move-Up Auditions - A standard repertoire of move-up music has been established and is available below. Students wishing to move up to Youth Strings or Youth Orchestra may only audition on the published audition date unless invited to do otherwise. All students are eligible to audition to move up to the next group. Students will be evaluated by the appropriate conductors.</p>

  <p class="grid_10 prefix_1 suffix_1">Seating Auditions – Seating auditions will be conducted at least one time per year and will determine where each musician sits within their ensemble. Students may be re-seated at the start of the second semester. If the conductor does not choose to re-seat his students at this time, students may use our challenge procedure to try to advance. At the conductors’ preference, seating auditions may be taped, held behind a screen or in front of the conductor(s). Taped auditions may be conducted by someone other than the conductor and will be evaluated by the appropriate conductor. The conductor will judge the live auditions. Make-up auditions are at the discretion of the conductors and if allowed must take place prior to the next regular rehearsal. Final seating decisions are at the discretion of the conductor.</p>

  <p class="grid_10 prefix_1 suffix_1">Brass and Woodwinds - All current brass and woodwind players will audition in the spring on the published date. Positions and seating for the next season will be based on this audition; adjustments may be made at any time at the discretion of the conductor. Please remember that participation in the current year does not guarantee a position the following season. New brass and woodwind players may also audition in the spring, fall or at the convenience of the conductor and as the need arises for a particular instrument.</p>

<div class="challenge">
  <h1 class="grid_5 prefix_3 suffix_4"> Challenge procedure</h1>
  <p class="grid_10 prefix_1 suffix_1">Purpose: Challenges are in place to provide students with opportunities for advanced seating within their ensemble. The expectation is to foster healthy competition among players in the group. Standards of performance are elevated when students must maintain their “chair”.</p>

  <p class="grid_10 prefix_1 suffix_1">Guidelines:</p>
  <ol class="grid_10 prefix_1 suffix_1">
  <li>First stands of sections are set for the semester. Challenges may occur within the first stand between the principal and assistant principal. All others may challenge up to third chair. In cases of less than four players in a section, this does not apply. In the case of first and second violin sections, the third chair second violin may challenge the last chair first violin.</li>

  <li>The student wishing to challenge must ask the conductor’s permission. The conductor will choose the challenge music with both students present. They will determine a mutually agreeable time for the challenge.</li>

  <li>The same student may not be challenged more than once in a single semester. This is to avoid an unnecessary strain on the same student.</li>

  <li>The conductor will listen to both players. The challenger must play first. A decision will be made that day and students will be notified.</li>

  <li>In order to maintain continuity in an ensemble, challenges may not happen within two weeks of a concert.</li>

  <li>6. All involved should remember that chair placement is only one aspect of the total orchestra experience. Both winner and loser of a challenge should maintain a cordial and sportsmanlike attitude after the result. Remember—we are a team!</li>
