  <h1> About WVYS </h1>
  <p>The West Virginia Youth Symphony originated in 1949 when the Charleston Woman’s Club organized the Kanawha Valley Youth Orchestra. It has operated continuously since then, becoming incorporated in 1968 as the Charleston Symphony Youth Orchestra and changing its name in 1991 to the West Virginia Youth Symphony. While the name has changed, the goal has remained the same - to provide opportunities for young people to perform in an orchestra setting.

  Each year, about 125 young musicians participate, making it both the largest and the oldest youth orchestra in the state. Students come from as far away as Ohio to rehearse weekly in Charleston. Ages range from 7 to 20, and students from 36 public and private schools, plus college and home-school, are making music together each week.</p>

  <h2> Missions </h2>
  <p> The West Virginia Youth Symphony (WVYS) seeks to provide the opportunity for individual growth of musically talented and motivated youth through the training and performance of the highest possible quality of orchestral and chamber music literature. The WVYS endeavors to develop pride and self-esteem in young people from all cultural backgrounds through their individual musical achievement and to instill values, discipline and learning abilities that will benefit them throughout their lives. The WVYS aspires to perpetuate support of professional classical music by enriching local culture and to increase the awareness of and participation in such music in underserved communities.</p>
